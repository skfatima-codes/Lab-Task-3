# Introduction
I am currently a student in the 2nd semester of the BS Computer Science program at the Department of Computer Science, University of Karachi UBIT. This project demonstrates my understanding of encapsulation, composition, and the command pattern in Java by building a Turtle Drawing System.

# Purpose
This Java-based project simulates a simple turtle drawing system using the Command Pattern. It interprets a string of characters as commands to move and turn a turtle with a pen on a canvas. Each command is encapsulated in its own class, and the turtle draws as it moves forward.
This is a simple Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project in Java that simulates a turtle moving on a canvas, drawing lines as it moves.



- `Turtle` controls the movement.
- `Pen` handles direction, angle, and drawing logic.
- `Canvas` stores lines drawn.
- `Line` holds line segment data (start and end points).
- `Main` is your launcher class where commands are execute
- `RightCommand,LeftCommand,ForwardCommand` are representing directions
